## Motivation

`Signal.swift` was born out of the need for a **minimal yet powerful** reactive layer suitable for large-scale iOS applications â€” like social networks or dating apps â€” without the overhead of RxSwift or Combine-only constraints.

Designed by [@ranjanakarsh](https://github.com/ranjanakarsh), it blends:

- **Actor-based safety** with Swift Concurrency  
- **Multicast emissions** with weak references  
- **Type erasure**, **Combine bridging**, and **value replay**  
- **Debouncing, throttling**, and event-state models  
- **Debug tracing and performance logging**

## âœ¨ Features

- Actor-isolated signals for race-free data propagation  
- Auto-cleanup of deallocated subscribers  
- `emit`, `complete`, `fail` for lifecycle awareness  
- Type-safe events: `.next`, `.completed`, `.failed`  
- Value replay with configurable buffer size (`ValueSignal`)  
- Throttled and debounced emissions  
- Combine-compatible `.publisher`  
- Token-based unsubscribe system  
- Lightweight â€” no third-party dependencies required (except `swift-atomics`)
